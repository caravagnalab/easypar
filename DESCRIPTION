Description: The easypar package makes it easy to implement parallel computations in R.
  To use this package, you need to have a function that 
  carries out your desired computation. easypar will take care of the
  burden of turning that function into a runnable parallel piece
  of code, offering a soilution based on the foreach and doParallel
  paradigms for parallel computing, or generating array jobs for the popular LSF 
  workload for distributed high performance computing.
